This document summarizes Themelio's "tokenomics" --- the incentives and rewards surrounding Themelio's two built-in tokens, **mel** and **sym**.

## Two tokens

Themelio has two main built-in cryptocurrency tokens:

- **Mel** is the default "money" of the blockchain. All fees and protocol-internal incentives are paid out in mel. It is an _endogenous stablecoin_ --- a currency that is both fully trustless and [can keep a relatively stable value]({{<ref "../basic-concepts/04-melmint.md">}}).
